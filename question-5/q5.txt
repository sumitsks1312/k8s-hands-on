1️⃣ Create a namespace named:

web-ns-q5

2️⃣ Deploy a Deployment using the following YAML:

Name: api-deploy

Namespace: web-ns-q5

Replicas: 2

Image: nginx:1.21

Container name: api-container

Add both liveness & readiness probes:

Type: HTTP GET

Path: /

Port: 80

Set resource requests & limits:

Requests: CPU 100m, Memory 128Mi

Limits: CPU 200m, Memory 256Mi

📌 Provide full YAML for Deployment inside the question (not applied), and ask the candidate to apply it.

3️⃣ After applying the YAML:

Verify if all pods become Running and both probes pass without restarting the pods.

4️⃣ Output required from candidate:

The current number of restarts for each pod

Explain why probes help prevent unnecessary restarts
