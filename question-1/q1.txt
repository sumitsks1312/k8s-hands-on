All work must be done in the namespace cka-lab-q1.

You are asked to verify that a Pod can successfully communicate with another Pod using a ClusterIP Service.

Tasks
1. Create a Pod

Create a Pod named web-pod using image:

nginx:1.21-alpine

2. Expose the Pod as a ClusterIP Service

Create a Service named web-svc:

Type: ClusterIP

Port: 8080

TargetPort: 80

3. Create a Test Pod

Create a Pod named test-pod using image:

busybox


This Pod must remain running:

sleep 3600

4. Verify HTTP Access

From inside test-pod, send an HTTP request to web-svc and save the output to:

/opt/cka/q1/web-check.txt


(You must exec into the Pod and redirect the output properly.)

5. Verify Service DNS

Check that the DNS name resolves successfully:

web-svc.cka-lab-q1.svc.cluster.local
